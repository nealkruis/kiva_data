Kiva
====

Kiva is a ground heat transfer calculation tool written in C++. Specifically, Kiva is used
to calculate heat loss and gain on a timestep basis from building foundations.

------------

Kiva is configured as an Eclipse project built using the GCC toolchain.

To build Kiva, you'll need to import the Git repository into your copy of Eclipse. I prefer using [eGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/) to interface with Git from within Eclipse.

Pre-requisites:

1. Eclipse
2. eGit
3. GCC

Kiva has a few library dependencies which you will need in order to compile the code.

1. [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
2. [SparseSuite](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/)
3. [MathGL](http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/)
